      'Welcome to The Singers Talk podcast based on my book of the same name. I’m Jason Thomas Gordon (singer/drummer of the Los Angeles rock band Kingsize), and when I first started singing for my band, I couldn’t believe there was no resource to find out how singers do this brutal job night after night. For something that seems easy, it can be truly dangerous, often embarrassing, and when you’re lucky… absolutely glorious. \nSo, this is me, reaching out to some of the greatest, most iconic singers of our time, discussing the one the thing they’re never asked about: their voices! Never thinking this was going to be a podcast, most of the interviews you’re going to hear are the intimate conversations, as I write the actual book… \nIf you’re a music fan, you’ll get a backstage look at how your favorite vocalists approach what they do onstage and in the studio. Packed with amazing stories you’ve never heard before, you’ll also find vulnerable sides of their personalities you might never have expected. \nAnd if you’re a singer, trying to train, help, heal, or even find your voice — you’ll learn how the best in their field keep their vocal cords in shape, how they protect themselves on the road, and countless other tricks, strategies, and philosophies…\nNot a technical podcast in any way, The Singers Talk celebrates the people who stand up in front of that mic, reach down into their guts, and give everything they’ve got for the sake of the song. Sometimes it’s bloody. And sometimes it’s bloody hilarious. ',

      "Welcome to The Message, an interview series about music, culture, mental health, and politics, brought to you by Apple Music.\nThe summer of 2020 was marked by an unprecedented awareness for--and anger about--the continued injustices Black people and people of color in America and worldwide face. The ensuing protests, activations, and social media fury inspired musicians around the world to speak out about their own experiences, with some going on to record music that speaks directly to the moment. Hosted by Apple Music's Ebro Darden, The Message is a series that aims to further the dialogue about the unrest and inequalities in the United States and abroad via intimate conversations with some of the most prominent voices in the culture today, who also create exclusive playlists of the songs inspiring them to keep pushing forward.\nGuests include Jon Batiste, Erykah Badu, Jon Stewart, Nikole Hannah-Jones, Common, Vince Staples, and many more. Follow to get the uncut and uncensored interviews delivered to you every two weeks, and subscribe to Apple Music to listen to the guests' playlists and add them to your library.",

      'Music is finite, opinions are endless. On The Album Years podcast, long term friends, collaborators and music nerds Steven Wilson and Tim Bowness discuss and bicker about their favourite music released during the golden album years, which they reckon to be from around 1965 to the end of the millennium. Each episode focuses on a single year picked at random. At the end of each episode they pick their personal favourites and the album they think had the most long-term impact on music. Can you guess which albums they will pick?',
